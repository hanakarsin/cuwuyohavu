I do not condone violence, looting, or breaking the law," he said.</p><p>Jake concluded his statement by saying that he was just trying to "raise awareness" by filming, and that he wanted everyone to "join together and evolve."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In his June 3 YouTube video, Jake reiterated that he felt it was his duty as a filmmaker to record what he was seeing at the mall.&nbsp;</p><p>"Being a filmmaker, and someone who documents virtually everything that happens in my life to be able to share it with the world, I wanted to use my platform to film what was going on, and what is going on in our country as we speak to be able to share and spread our message to the world and spread awareness," he said.</p><p>"We shouldn't just be doing nothing. When we heard that there were going to be protests taking place in Arizona, we wanted to be involved and show our support," he continued.</p><p>Jake stated that he and Andrew walked toward the mall at around 10 p.m., after they had been protesting all day.
