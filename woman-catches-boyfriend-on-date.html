If you're <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>, you might take a Louisville Slugger to your S.O.'s 4-wheel drive.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Or you might just dump them over text, do your own thing and stay away from dating and seeing other people for a while until you're ready to get back in the saddle, so to speak.</p><p>Then there are folks who decide to go and get revenge by immediately going on a dating/hook-up rampage as a means of "getting back" at their now-ex.</p><p>But what happens if you suspect that your significant other is cheating and decide to find out for yourself if they're actually doing you dirty behind your back?</p><p>That's what this TikToker did and the results were unfortunate, but some that many TikTokers found hilarious, just based on her boyfriend's response.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Cyn must've thought that there was something strange about her boyfriend's behavior because she decided to track his location on his phone and saw that he was at a restaurant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So when she went to the restaurant to see what was going on, there her boyfriend was, on a date with another woman.
