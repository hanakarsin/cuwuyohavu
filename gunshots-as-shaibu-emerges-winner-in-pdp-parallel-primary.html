Now that they have pushed you away, they want to go and replace you but I assure you that your vote must count, they cannot change and replace your names.</p><p>“I assure you that I will take your protest to the committee that is coming but you must remain peaceful in everything you are doing.”</p><p>Speaking to journalists later, Shaibu said, “I saw the crowd outside and I asked who they are and they said they are delegates, I said they should be directed to the venue of the accreditation but they said they were protesting because they have been sent away from the venue if accreditation and they won their election and they have their results.</p><p>“The election will hold and if a winner emerges with fake delegates, the election will not see the light of the day but if a winner emerges with the authentic delegate, there will be no problem, I am sure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FrZqCtnqi1sMDSZpisZaOdrqqu1Gacpp2inLK0edaipaedomK2r3nPnadmqJGnrq24xKVkqaqZoq6zxY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./90210-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="90210 - Cast, Ages, Trivia">&larr;
