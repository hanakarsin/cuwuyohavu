style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspapers headlines in Nigeria for today, Thursday, 30th September 2021</h2><p>The Nigerian Senate has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to stop treating bandits and kidnappers in the country with kid gloves.</p><p>In a series of resolutions during plenary on Wednesday, the upper chamber urged the President to declare bandits as terrorists and treat them the same way Boko Haram insurgents are being treated.</p><p>The Red chamber called on the Federal Government to wage total war against the bandits, including bombing all their locations to annihilate and eliminate them.</p><p>According to the Senate, all known leadership of the bandits should be declared wanted and the military should arrest and prosecute them.</p><p>The Senate observed a minute of silence in honour of the fallen heroes and civilians who lost their lives in the unwholesome activities of the bandits.</p><p>The Governor Nasiru El Rufai-led Kaduna State government has banned commercial and private motor cycles in the northwest state.</p><p>Naija News reports that this was made know at a press conference by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan.</p><p>According to the Kaduna government, the ban, which will last for three months, is expected to take effect from Thursday.</p><p>The government also banned the possession of weapons.</p><p>Unknown gunmen have killed Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband to late former Information Minister, Prof. Dora Akunyili.</p><p>It was gathered that Dr. Chike was murdered by the gunmen at Umuoji in Idemili North LGA of Anambra State on Tuesday evening.</p><p>A source disclosed that the late minister’s husband had earlier visited the University of Nigeria Nsukka Alumni Association (UNAA) where the late Dora was honoured.</p><p>He was attacked and murdered on his way back to his base.</p><p>The Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has approved a 14-day paternity leave for male civil servants to allow them bond with their babies.</p><p>Naija News reports that the decision was reached during the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) held on Wednesday.</p><p>This was disclosed to State House correspondents by the Head of Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, after the week’s virtual FEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.</p><p>According to Yemi-Esan, this is to enable for proper bonding between the father and a newborn, either natural-born or adopted, especially at the early stages of the child’s life.</p><p>She added that fathers of adopted babies of less than four months will also enjoy this gesture.</p><p>The Federal Government has been restricted from retrying the former Governor of Abia State and Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu.</p><p>Naija News reports that Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja gave the judgement on Wednesday.</p><p>The presiding judge asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to stop the planned retrial of Kalu based on the N7.1billion money laundering charge earlier preferred against him.</p><p>Justice Ekwo held that the Supreme Court did not in the verdict it gave on May 8, 2020, order the retrial of either Kalu or his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited.</p><p>The presiding judge ruled that the apex court only ordered the retrial of former Director of Finance in Abia State, Jones Udeogu, who was the Appellant before it.</p><p>A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Salihu Lukman, says the ruling party may collapse after the exit of President Muhammadu Buhari from Aso Rock.</p><p>Naija News reports that Lukman, Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, stated this in an interview on a programme on African Independent Television (AIT) on Wednesday.</p><p>Lukman said the APC needs to strengthen its internal democracy and its members must be committed to the party’s ideology for the party not to collapse after the 2023 elections.</p><p>He added that for APC to remain in power and viable, the national leadership of the party must guide its members towards fully embracing progressive ideals for the party.</p><p>Lukman noted that the organs of the party should be meeting regularly to make decisions that would drive the progress and stability of the ruling party.</p><p>According to Lukman, decisions by the party leadership should be well thought out and debated before they are taken.</p><p>The Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government has declared Friday, October 1 as a public holiday to celebrate Nigeria’s 61st Independence Anniversary Celebration.</p><p>This was made known by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Naija News reports.</p><p>He congratulated all Nigerians on this year’s Celebration of the Country’s 61st anniversary and assured of the government’s commitment to tackling and eradicating all forms of challenges –be they political, socio-economic or otherwise.</p><p>According to the minister, celebrating Nigeria’s independence anniversary is necessary but the safety of the citizenry is President Muhammadu Buhari’s huge concern.</p><p>In order to stop the imminent total shutdown of the health sector, the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA) have issued a fresh directive to the Federal Government.</p><p>In a statement issued on Tuesday by its National Chairman, Biobelemoye Josiah, JOHESU asked the government to quickly address the demands of health workers in the country.</p><p>Naija News reports that JOHESU had on two occasions given the federal government a 15-day ultimatum to address its demands.</p><p>According to Josiah, JOHESU asked the government to speed up its efforts on the issues raised in order to avoid the closure of health facilities across the country.</p><p>He added that the unions noted the appeal from President Muhammadu Buhari on the need to show understanding with his administration and his pledge to pay any debt owed to health workers.</p><p>Josiah appealed to the federal government to act according to agreements reached, adding that JOHESU is not a “strike monger”.</p><p>The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has denied any kind of responsibility or involvement in the murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Professor Dora Akunyili.</p><p>The group on Wednesday through its spokesperson, Emma Powerful submitted that it doesn’t kill people and specifically, it has nothing against the murdered Akunyili.</p><p>Powerful stated further that the gunmen who assassinated Dr. Akunyuli are working closely with those who poisoned and killed Prof. Akunyuli herself as they are after the entire family.</p><p>He added that politicians are the ones behind all the killings in Anambra State.</p><p>It will be recalled as earlier reported by Naija News that unknown gunmen murdered Dr. Chike at Umuoji in Idemili North LGA of Anambra State on Tuesday evening.</p><p>Following the murder, there have been speculations in some quarters that the Nnamdi Kanu-led secessionist group, IPOB was responsible for the killing.</p><p>But IPOB in its reaction to the allegation said those sponsoring the school of thought are only out to tarnish the group’s image and turn the people of Anambra State against them.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has withdrawn the nomination of Engr. Sarki Auwalu as Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).</p><p>Naija News reports that this was made known in a letter dated September 28, 2021 and read by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on the floor of the Senate at plenary.</p><p>President Buhari on Wednesday nominated Engr. Farouk Ahmed as Auwalu’s replacement.</p><p>He asked the senate to replace Engr. Sarki Auwalu with Engr. Farouk A. Ahmed as Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Buhari said the replacement request was done in accordance with the provision of Section 34(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
