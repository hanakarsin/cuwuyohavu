That is what we will continue to do. President Goodluck Jonathan has lost the Senate.</i></p><p><i>"Since he has left the PDP structures in the hands of the governors, let the governors also come and do our jobs. We are going to shut the government.</i></p><p><i>“What is it that the president asked that we’ve not given to him? We are going to show solidarity with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal. We will not sit again. There will be no consideration of the MTEF (Medium Term Expenditure Framework) and there will be no budget. We may also begin his impeachment.</i></p><p><i>“When we invoked the doctrine of necessity, we even proceeded to give him the full option. We did the same thing on the state of emergency. But now, he has lost the Senate.</i></p><p><i>"By the time the House of Representatives resumes on December 3, most of the PDP members in the House would have lost their return bids and they will quickly move to APC and populate the party,</i>” the senator told newsmen.</p><p>It was gathered that Tuesday’s session was presided over by Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu as the Senate President David Mark was said to be attending the National Council of State meeting at the Presidential Villa.</p><p>However, the senators who said they had the full backing of their APC counterparts in their resolve to shut down the chamber, added that if Mark opts to stall the move, he would have to be abandoned and be left to preside over an empty chamber.</p><p>It was also learnt that most of the PDP senators whose fate has been sealed are already knocking at the doors of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), asking to be allowed to fly the party’s flag in the next election.</p><p>Another source informed that the Senate resolved to shut down legislative business because governors have been empowered by the PDP headquarters to deny them re-election tickets.</p><p>The source informed that&nbsp;the Senate would in the next few days show openly its solidarity with House of Representatives Speaker Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, whose defection from PDP to the APC has caused a huge row.</p><p>He&nbsp;insisted that they are prepared to fight their battle with any weapon open to them, wondering why the President and first-time PDP governors are given automatic tickets and legislators are not.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHKDkGpvZqaZnLKztcCnZKydnpbBpnnToamemaSau7R506hkoqWgmq6ktIypqZ6rmZmyr8CMo6anmaSdrq96x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./icag-alex-guarnaschelli-meaning.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Does Everyone Call Chef Alex Guarnaschelli &amp;quot;ICAG&amp;quot;?">&larr;
