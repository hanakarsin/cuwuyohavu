He cannot continue to run the state without a budget.</p><p>“We will not stand aside and watch him violate the legal and constitutional agreement. We will not allow Fubara to disrespect the office of the President.</p><p>“Drafting a chairman or a sole administrator to oversee a local government is an aberration; only elected executives are recognised by law.</p><p>“Although no time frame was given for implementing the resolution, the governor cannot run the state without a budget.”</p><p>Okocha claimed that Fubara, who was “an unexpected candidate in the PDP primaries, rode to power on Wike’s support</p><p>“The governor was not a politician but a career civil servant, but Wike sat on the noses of politicians and threw up Fubara who lacked political background.</p><p>“Nobody gives power for nothing without negotiating for something; Fubara has reneged on agreements reached in the bedroom.”</p><p>But Information and Communications Commissioner Johnson advised Okocha to focus on his duties at the NDDC.</p><p>He said, “The governor has recalled and redeployed the commissioners who resigned – that is even more important.</p><p>“Governor Fubara has also paid all the allowances owed to the 27 members of the State House Assembly.</p><p>“If the governor refused to release funds to the lawmakers but went ahead to represent a budget to them, which one, in Okocha’s priority, will be better?”</p><p>“The resolutions were agreed upon in December and, by February, the governor had implemented six out of the eight proclamations.</p><p>“The governor is acting on the resolutions step-by-step. Okocha should stop chasing shadows.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FvZquhppq%2FtHnCq6CsoaNirrGvjJypoqyZmLa7sdJmnqiulae7sL6Mn6ybmaKWeqe70WalqKxdnrqxuMSmnKesmaO0bq3Gq5yepZWjwW7DyK2fZqyZo8KjwY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./video-how-dss-re-arrested-emefiele-after-clash-with-prison-officials.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How DSS Re-Arrested Emefiele After Clash With Prison Officials">&larr;
