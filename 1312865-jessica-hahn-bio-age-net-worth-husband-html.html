She also featured in several television shows and movies, including <i>Married....with Children</i> as Esther, <i>Unhappily Ever After</i> as Miss Taylor, <i>Blossom</i> as Girl #1, <i>Dream On</i> as reporter 1. However, there are no clues as to whether she would come back to modeling and acting.</p><h2>What really happened to Jessica Hahn?</h2><p class=align-left>According to the American model and actress, she revealed that Jim Bakker, alongside John Wesley Fletcher, numbed and ravished her for about fifteen minutes on a hot afternoon in December 1980, while she worked for Bakker's church. According to reports, she was given a whooping sum of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$279,000</a> to hush her and conceal the shameful act. The payment was disbursed from PTL's fund through one of Bakker's colleague, Roe Messner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0dfddd90dbb7c9d0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jaclyn Glenn biography: age, height, boyfriend, past relationships</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bakker, who was the mastermind behind all monetary decisions for the PTL organization, supposedly hid two sets of books to cover up the computation irregularities. However, some correspondents led by Charles Shepard from The Charlotte Observer interrogated and distributed several papers as regards the PTL institution finances.</p><p class=align-left>This singular act led to Bakker's concession and the publication of Hahn's claim. In 1989, Bakker was sentenced to five years imprisonment for extorting PTL's partners by overselling available rooms in the Heritage Grand lodge in Fort Mill. He wrote and publicized a book, <i>I was wrong</i>, in 1996 after he was released from the cell. In the book, Bakker acknowledged that he had intercourse with Hahn, although he knew it was wrong. However, he argued that the intercourse was without coercion.</p><p class=align-left>Hahn once contemplated turning her life story to a book, but she feels she does not have the patience needed in writing one. Before this time, she was very effective in the show business during the 90s.

According to her, she is still mad at the man who manipulated her with power and an image of God into having []. She stressed that the incidence implicated the rest of her life.</p><h2>Where is Jessica Hahn now?</h2><p class=align-left>Jessica Hahn now lives on a ranch north of about 45-acre with her sweetheart and her pet turkey named Pearl in Los Angeles.
