Two years later, they reportedly called the transgender community "nut jobs."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Twitter user @CarnieGamer was also able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attest to Kimberly and Beck's use of hateful language</a>.
