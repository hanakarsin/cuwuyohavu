Since my adult life, I have taken part in many political processes and situations, from presenting myself for election as candidate of political party and being saddled with administration of political party as national secretary, I, therefore, need not have difficulty to decipher any political move,” a source told Vanguard.</p><p>“With the interactions I have had with several stakeholders in the last one year, the Vice President is running. His body language is tilted towards that.”</p><p>The source stated that VP Osinbajo would follow due process and the law in declaring his presidential ambition.</p><p>“Don’t forget that the Vice President is a Professor of Law and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN,” the source said.</p><p>”The electoral process, like every other law in the world, is governed by law. Whosoever that will declare now will be flouting the Electoral Act, that is why till date, all those who say they are running will say they are consulting. The rule of the game as of now has not permitted anybody to declare any intention.</p><p>“So, nobody should expect him to declare until the law says so. The consultations are going on. Most of his aides and others are fully in the project. We are consulting and recently, we were in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, and the feedback from Uyo is that he (Osinbajo) should run.</p><p>”We had political giants, senators former ministers, and captains of industries asking him to run; that is consultation. The other time, we were in Kano and they asked him to run and everywhere we have been to, he is being asked to run.</p><p>”You engage everybody. He’s responsive, this is the collective aspirations of Nigeria and the VP will respond at the appropriate time. He is running.</p><p>“I am aware that he is going to meet with state chairman of the APC, but I’m not privy to what would be discussed therein. Mind you, I am not one of the the state chairmen of APC, I wasn’t invited but I know he is meeting with them. As of today (yesterday), we have 720 groups who are supporting the VP. He is contesting.</p><p>“The VP has to follow the law because if he should declare today, those asking him to declare will still be the same people who will accuse him of jumping the gun.”</p><p>He stated that Osinbajo will not jump the gun because he is a Professor of Law and a SAN that knows the law.</p><p>The source added that Osinbajo would not even want to heat up the polity as President Buhari is out of the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BtZmtoYmh6t7yMqKqippKWt7B51pqlratdqbxuv9Scmp6dlGKvtrTAq6Bmq6Seua15wqilrK2cqbavs44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./368765-francis-atwoli-rhumba-band-serenade-wife-mary-kilobi-birthday-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Francis Atwoli gets Rhumba band to serenade wife Mary Kilobi on her birthday">&larr;
