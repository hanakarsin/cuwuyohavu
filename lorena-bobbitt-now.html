After she was found not guilty by reason of insanity (her husband was acquitted, as well), Lorena became vilified and mocked, her name turned into a punch line. "I was the subject of so many jokes in the '90s and to me it was just cruel. They didn't understand. Why would they laugh about my suffering?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorena told</a> The New York Times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>However, after years of therapy, she grew to understand why people were fascinated with the story and how absurd everything sounded when put together (the penis, the hot dog box — even her ex-husband's last name).</p><p>"I'll put myself through the jokes and everything as long as I can shine a light on domestic violence and sexual assault and marital rape," Lorena added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: Prime Video</span></figure><p>Which is probably why she agreed to participate in the creation of the 2019 Amazon Prime four-part docuseries Lorena (executive produced by Jordan Peele), and why she's OK with being back in the spotlight again, promoting her new Lifetime movie, I Was Lorena Bobbitt, out May 25.&nbsp;</p><p>"People used to judge me before, saying that they don't believe my story. To tell the story again is more than a blessing, to me it is an opportunity to tell it right," Lorena, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who now goes by Lorena Gallo</a>, told Entertainment Tonight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Lorena Bobbitt (Gallo) up to now?</h2><p>After the trial, Lorena had to serve some time at a psychiatric hospital. When shewas released, she went back to her life as a manicurist, and later became a hair stylist, and then a real estate agent. She went to church on a regular basis and started going to community college, where she met her now partner, David Bellinger.</p><p>At first they were friends, but then after a couple years, they became romantically involved. Although the two aren't married, they do have a 13-year-old daughter together. The family lives in Manassas, Va.</p><p>Above all, Lorena said she wanted her life back. "When I finished with the trial, in the beginning, geez, I couldn't even go to the grocery store because people would say, 'Oh my god, You know what, I know you.' I just wanted to put my groceries down and go home. I just wanted to take care of myself and my family. You know, just to integrate myself into normalcy and a normal life," she told the NYT.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>With the docuseries and Lifetime movies — and with her work advocating for abused women — Lorena said she hopes that her story will continue to positively impact laws around domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope to reclaim my life that way. It's a shame that it took so long for people to actually see it through the lens of the #MeToo movement and the perspective of domestic violence," Lorena told ET.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, "For many years, I kept a low profile and I avoided the attention. I felt that it was the right thing to do, to come forward with my story. If I could help at least one person escape domestic violence then all my pain and suffering that I went through was not in vain."</p><p>John Bobbitt lives in Las Vegas. He participated in the Amazon docuseries, in which he maintains his innocence, even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's been accused of domestic violence</a> by several partners he's had after he and Lorena divorced.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"It's all made up and I'm tired of it. I was with a lot of of women ... and none of them ever complained, except Lorena. And Joanna," John told the NYT.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Lorena, John still harasses her and sends her love letters; she obviously has no intention of ever getting back together with him.</p><p>These days, Lorena runs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Lorena Gallo Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that helps victims of domestic violence. She spends a lot of time with her family.</p><p>&nbsp;Her most recent Instagram post is from Easter, which shows the now 49-year-old Lorena enjoying a burger and a glass of wine (with a side of hand sanitizer, of course) in Old Alexandria, presumably with her partner and daughter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Celebrated Easter in Old Town Alexandria at the waterfront park.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Lorena Gallo</a> (@lorenagallo15) on Apr 13, 2020 at 11:40am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Although Lorena doesn't share very many pictures of her family, here's one she posted of herself and her daughter over the holidays back in December 2018.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>For someone to go through so much pain and humiliation and come out want to help others is truly an inspiration.
