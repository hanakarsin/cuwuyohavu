So I've decided that I'm not going to do any work until I get paid for that work," she says as she looks into the camera, rocking a pair of sunglasses.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@devondittmer href=#>@devondittmer</a><p>Baby don’t work for free <a title=payday href=#>#payday</a> <a title=corporatelife href=#>#corporatelife</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Sweet D" href=#>♬ original sound - Sweet D</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @devondittmer</span></figure><p>Devon goes on to say that this isn't the first late payment occurrence she's experienced: "This has happened maybe three or four times in the almost five years that I've been working here where she just forgets to run payroll and me or one of my co-workers has to remind her hey we're supposed to be getting paid because that is our transactional relationship," she says, motioning with her hand from her chest towards the camera.</p><p>Devon goes on to explain what the nature of working a job is — folks aren't doing it just for fun.</p><p>"I don't come here for the f---- fun of it. So, am I being unreasonable? Am I the a--hole? Honestly I don't give a f---," she says into the camera as the video closes out.</p><p>It seemed that there were several other folks who agreed with Devon's "Baby Don't Work For Free" philosophy (which she shared in a caption for the video).</p><p>One person wrote: "Good for you for walking out. I would have too."</p><p>There were others who didn't think the manager just "forgot" to initiate payroll for employees.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @devondittmer</span></figure><p>"No one just forgets to run payroll!" one person said.</p><p>While someone else remarked: "An owner thinks about payroll every day. Every. Single. Day."</p><p>There were others who thought that simply walking out was now enough: "File a complaint with the labor board!" they penned.</p><p>"How does one forget to do payroll??" another user on the application wrote in response to the clip.</p><p>Some folks spoke from personal experience, like this one person who suggested that the reason why workers weren't getting paid is because the business didn't have enough to cover their expenditures.</p><p>"She didn't forget ... she knew there wasn't enough money to cover payroll! Been there, done that," they wrote.</p><p>There was another user on the application who shared their father's philosophy when he was running his own business and he was hell-bent on ensuring workers were receiving their payouts first: "My dad ran his own business. He always said employees get paid before anyone, including vendors and himself."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @devondittmer</span></figure><p>This was a philosophy shared by someone else who said that they work as an office administrator: "As an office admin, I have never and could never forget payroll! The employees have to be paid, no question about it."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Find Law</a> published a lengthy piece about workers' right[s] to a timely paycheck, including the steps employees should take if they're not being compensated in a timely fashion.</p><p>They wrote that the first course of action is to contact your employer in writing and ask for prompt payment of the wages owed to you," followed by filing an official wage claim with a state's labor agency or attorney general.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @devondittmer</span></figure><p>Next up — folks are encouraged to file a complaint with the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and then sue their employer in small claims court or superior court for the amount owed.</p><p>The online resource went on to state that according to the federal government's Fair Labor Standards Act, you have two years to lodge a formal complaint about a late payment from an employer. They added that individual state laws also play a factor in these grievances as well, so make sure to look at more granular cases when it comes to your particular area's laws.</p><p>If you have an issue with a late/incorrect payment from an employee or have any paycheck gripes whatsoever, hit up the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc2sZKmZqZi1pq%2FKZqOarJViuaat1Z6qZq%2Bfp7g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./claudio-marchisio-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Claudio Marchisio - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
