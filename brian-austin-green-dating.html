The Beverly Hills, 90210 star revealed at the time that the two had first been introduced through their mutual business manager, telling Access Daily, "We met and we had great conversation." He added, "It's been great so far."&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it seems as though the relationship even has <a href=#>Megan Fox's</a> seal of approval! Keep reading to find out more about Brian and Sharna's dating life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess confirmed that they are officially dating.</h2><p>Nothing says "we're dating" like an Instagram post. On Jan. 11, 2021, Sharna shared a picture of the couple kissing, which she captioned, "HIM."&nbsp;</p><p>Relationship rumors had sparked in 2020 with the pair being photographed together, enjoying a trip to Hawaii. However, the actor had not been quick to put a label on their romance just yet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ＳｈａｒｎａＢｕｒｇｅｓｓ (@sharnaburgess)</a></p></figure><p>"She's an amazing woman. She's super responsible, she's super sweet and caring, passionate, fun to be around. I feel blessed right now," he told Access Daily on Jan. 9, 2021. "It's all going really well right now. It's early on so we don't have any labels for anything, obviously."</p><p>The pair then became Instagram-official when Sharna shared the photo of the two of them kissing. Her post came just one week after Sharna told her Instagram followers to "let it go" when it came to asking questions about her dating life.&nbsp;</p><p>When one fan had asked the DWTS dancer about her relationship status, she replied via Instagram Stories at the time, "Lol. Y'all don't give up on this one. It's almost impossible to fish out real questions amidst ones about my relationship status. I say this with love and kindness: Let it go."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Though Brian confirmed his separation from Megan in May 2020, this is not the first woman he's been spotted with.

However, Brian denied that he was romantically involved with them. After being photographed picking up food with Courtney, days later, the father of four was seen eating lunch at Tina's restaurant, Sugar Taco.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>asked him in July 2020 if he was dating the entrepreneur. He said, "Tina is really cool. I literally just met her that day at her restaurant on the sidewalk."&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, he said that Courtney was "super nice but disappointing."&nbsp;</p><p>Brian explained that Courtney posted a video of him in a hot tub giving a shout-out to a woman named Ashley. "I was just trying to be a nice guy and I shot a video for her friend Ashley, saying hello," he said, explaining that the hot tub video was shot one month prior.&nbsp;</p><p>He added, "The fact that she decided to post that the day Tina and I had lunch, knowing that it would create problems for Tina and myself ... It kind of sucks."</p><p>He continued, "It was just disappointing, but I don't want to bash Courtney. I think she's a nice person. I just think she's making some bad choices."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Megan commented on Brian's recent Instagram pic saying she's "grateful" for Sharna.</h2><p>On July 6, 2021, Brian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> a photo of him and Sharna sharing a cute kiss, and fans were totally there for it.</p><p>"It’s been a really long time since I’ve been with someone I can truly share life with," he captioned the photo, followed by a red heart emoji.</p><p>Not only were fans gushing over their love, but even Brian's ex also took to the comments to give props to her former husband's new boo.</p><p>"Grateful for Sharna," commented the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles actress alongside a purple heart emoji.</p><p>Sharna also responded to the photo, commenting, "There's no one else I could ever imagine sharing it with.
