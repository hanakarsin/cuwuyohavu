Like saying "bless you" after a person sneezes, which was reportedly popularized by Pope Gregory I, who believed that humans were susceptible to death whilst forcibly evacuating air from their nostrils. The "bless you" protected them from an otherwise gnarly death.</p><p>That's just one of many persistent traditions, but what about others? For example, why do <a href=#>British lawyers wear wigs</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Seriously, why do British lawyers wear wigs?</h2><p>How weird and hilarious was it when you were first skimming through your social studies book as a kid and realized that George Washington wasn't the only OG U.S. politician to rock that ridiculous hairstyle? And how much more bizarre was it to discover that British legal workers today carry on the tradition of wearing a white wig that looks more in place on a caricature of a judge in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Toad's Wild Ride</a> than in a modern-day courtroom?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Stuff Works</a>, the entire purpose of a lawyer wearing a wig is to reinforce the idea of anonymity; it's basically the same concept as "the law is blind." The law should be "blind" to race, ethnicity, social standing, net worth, Instagram followers, or your political affiliations.</p><p>The outlet compares the wig to a uniform: "Like many uniforms, wigs are an emblem of anonymity, an attempt to distance the wearer from personal involvement and a way to visually draw on the supremacy of the law, says Newton. Wigs are so much a part of British criminal courts that if a barrister doesn't wear a wig, it's seen as an insult to the court."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The wigs and robes worn by judges and lawyers in former British colonies are among the most glaring symbols of colonial inheritance; an inheritance so old-fashioned and uncomfortable that even British barristers have stopped wearing them.<a href=#>https://t.co/T3aGEDw8yW</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iqWBRTH8cW</a></p>— This Is Africa (@ThisIsAfricaTIA) <a href=#>August 31, 2018</a></figure><p>Judges and barristers wear wigs too, however, they're different than the ones that lawyers sport. Barrister wigs have a little more razzle-dazzle to them, and the wigs that judges rock make them look more like a final boss than anyone else in the courtroom.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did people start wearing wigs in the first place? Because humans are disgusting.</h2><p>Historically speaking, there are some cultures that either disliked taking baths or didn't develop hygienic means of living for one reason or another. By modern standards, life in 16th and 17th century Britain was, well, kind of revolting.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I feel like the only thing missing from the groom's suit is that fake ass wig British lawyer's used to wear <a href=#>#OurPerfectWedding</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9AqpOQniax</a></p>— Thato wa di SexToys (@THEETHATOR) <a href=#>February 25, 2018</a></figure><p>That's because folks didn't really bathe all that often and instead thought it would be better to just wipe oneself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with a white linen cloth</a>. No one really seemed to care that much about hygiene as they were probably just wondering where their next meal was coming from, so naturally, lice became a huge problem.</p><p>Instead of, you know, altering society to find a way to lead cleaner, healthier lives, they decided to just put on wigs instead, and it kind of worked. Instead of attacking people's actual hair, the lice would infest the wigs instead, so folks were either free to shave their own scalps or cover their natural hair with a cloth while a bunch of bugs gathered on their wigs instead.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BRITISH LAWYERS STILL WEAR THE POWEDERED WIGS???!! fuck imagine being arrested for a crime in britain and then going to court and everyone looks like this. i can’t do this i don’t think i would be able to stop myself from laughing <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rZ1ivb27kd</a></p>— hazel (@paintedpaw) <a href=#>August 25, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wondering if I could pull off the British lawyer wig look</p>— Rob (@somewhatMPLS) <a href=#>April 21, 2021</a></figure><p>It must've helped that the wigs were made out of white horsehair, with cheaper wigs fashioned out of a shaved goat's follicles instead. It didn't take long for wigs to become a status symbol, and if that seems weird to you, well, just remember that sneakers transformed from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being no-nonsense athletic wear to a multi-billion dollar industry</a> and there are people who dedicate their entire lives to sneaker reselling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZJuqmam2tLSMpZiwsZWnwG7DxJqpZq%2BZnMA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jean-claude-van-damme-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jean-Claude Van Damme - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
