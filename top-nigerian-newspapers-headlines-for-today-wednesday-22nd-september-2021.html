whether we are president or vice-president, we will lead Nigeria.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, the Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland stated that Baba-Ahmed’s comments are capable of setting the country on fire.</p><p>Adams added that the statements only revealed the domineering agenda of the north and the plan to permanently perpetuate itself in power.</p><p>Some prominent Nigerians have formed the Rescue Nigeria Project (RNP) to give Nigerians an alternative platform to the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.</p><p>Founders of RNP include former governor of Kwara state, Ahmed Abdulfatai, Prof. Pat Utomi, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, former Governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke,</p><p>Senator Lee Maeba, Usman Bugaje, Prof. Attahiru Jega, Amb.
