They accused Tinubu of ignoring their nominees and replacing them with others from their respective states without consultation.</p><h2>Muslim-Muslim Ticket</h2><p>On the Muslim-Muslim ticket, another source told Daily Sun: “If there is a best way, I am sure that a Christian from the north would have been the best and I have no doubt in my mind about that, so why would they do a thing like that? The secretary to the government is a Christian and we do not win with votes from the North East, so, there is no excuse in the world because it is the North West that has the votes. So, you cannot say that he is going to bring all the votes from the north. The only thing that you can say is because he is a Muslim. A Muslim from the South is doing what a Muslim from the North would not do. A muslim from the north would not choose another Muslim from the South. We have spoken but they are not listening.</p><p>“We went through the trouble of doing restructuring and packaged it in a way that was so well received. Maybe they held their meetings and afterwards, the South West started saying something different because they want to be president. What kind of thing is that? I am very depressed and mortified and I don’t think that there is a better way to describe how I am feeling. We have decided to step aside and watch from the sidelines. We have totally lost it in this country. If we haven’t lost it, how can an Accountant General steal over N108 billion? That is to show you how lose we are.”</p><p>The source stated that the ruling APC has put a stamp of official approval on corruption and would find out that a lot of its members have not even read the party’s manifesto.</p><h2>APC NWC May Clash With PCC</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) is set to meet today to discuss on how to resolve the contentious issues.</p><p>It was gathered that the APC NWC has vowed to insist on compulsory rejigging of the comprehensive campaign list.</p><p>A member of the NWC disclosed that they have tolerated enough and “have decided in the interim to curtail their excesses now that the day is still young. If they should be this supercilious when we have not won the presidential election, only God knows what will happen to the future of the members of this party’s leadership if we finally emerge victorious.</p><p>“All I know is that at the meeting today, drastic ‘take-it-or-leave-it decisions will be taken during and I am sure that we are likely going to insist on the leadership of the council rejigging the list. We have to curtail the excesses of the PCC. We must checkmate them from riding roughshod over the leadership of this party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FxZpyqkZi4tHnIp2SaqJNirrR5wLKYnZ1dlq%2BlwcurmLOZm2K8tbTEq6pmmZ6cv7p5zq%2Bcq2Wknru2rtSsZJyZnaWuqrPNZpqorZ6Ytq15y6KqrWWdqsCttcxmpK6rnJ66bsDInKKerF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./342585-jombi-atishia-kumtandika-bamkwe-kwa-kudai-mahari-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jombi atishia kumtandika ba'mkwe kwa kudai mahari">&larr;
