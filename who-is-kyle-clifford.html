Police believe it was a crossbow, which was used in the attack. A manhunt was launched to find Clifford, who authorities discovered was the ex-boyfriend of one of Hunt's daughters.</p><p>Clifford grew up in Enfield and like many suspected murderers, was described as a "pretty normal" and "nice guy" by a woman who grew up with him. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky News</a> that "we would always be at the same parties together and hanging around in Enfield. He never seemed odd or aggressive."</p><p>After an extensive search for Clifford, police found him hiding at the Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield. As of the time of this writing, he is being treated for injuries he sustained, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>. Flowers and cards are already being placed at the Hunt home, with one card reading, "I wish none of this happened as real.

Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said, "Sadly, despite our best efforts, the women died a short time later, at the scene," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. It was determined that the weapon used was a crossbow.</p><p>Support for Hunt began pouring in on social media. "Everyone at Sky Sports Racing is deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in Hertfordshire and our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted Sky Sports Racing</a>. "John Hunt was, is, and always will be one of the best broadcasting professionals I have ever had the honor of working with, and one of the nicest members of the human race. My heart bleeds for him.
