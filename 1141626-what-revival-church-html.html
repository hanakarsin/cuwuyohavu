Spiritual revival includes a renewed love for God and things of God, appreciating the holiness of the Lord, a conviction of any personal sin or cooperate sin and a desire to repent and grow in righteousness, spiritual humility and a renewed passion and desire for the word of God and his church.</p><p class=align-left>Revival strengthens and deepens the faith of a Christian and also opens his or her eyes to God’s truth in a fresh and new way. It generally marks a new beginning of a life of obedience to God. One of the things revival does in the life of a believer is that it breaks the power of the world which holds the believer back from loving God. Spiritual revival gives a believer the strength to live in the world without an unholy love and desire for the things of the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/197682779a55c217.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jealousy vs Envy: how does the Bible differentiate between them?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Most powerful prayer mountains in Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/197682779a55c217.jpg><h2>What is revival in the church?</h2><p class=align-left>Revival meaning has been misunderstood and its essence has been lost among Christians today. Revival has been limited to a miracle and healing service where people fall under the anointing and different things happen. Revival and its true essence is something that can only be seen over a period of time, not just something that happens in a service.</p><p class=align-left>Do not get it wrong, revival can start in a church meeting or a special revival meeting, it can be collective or personal but it must go beyond that day. True spiritual revival must last and produce results or what is called fruits according to the scriptures. Revival is always initiated by the Holy Spirit by creating an awareness that something is missing in the life of the believers that can only be filled by God. Then followed by a simultaneous genuine response from the heart of believers by acknowledging their need for God and repentance. And through readiness and willingness, the Holy Spirit fills the believers with love for God and strength to build a personal relationship with God.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49443c94193f87a8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Christian podcasts for you and your loved ones</span></p></a><h2>Revival in the scriptures</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6fdpjkqbfdn.jpg><p class=align-left>In the Acts of the Apostle Chapter 2, after Jesus Christ had died, resurrected and ascended, a great revival took place in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. The disciples following the instructions of Jesus were gathered in one room praying. God poured out the Holy Spirit on every single person in the room and on that day Simon Peter preached a single message that got about three thousand people saved. In Acts Chapter 2 verse 42 to 47, we can see the fruits and testimony of the aftermath of the revival:</p><p class=align-left><i>“And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.”</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0507c44c18ef423.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best bible verses about family that assure you peace</span></p></a><p class=align-left>And this how the church began to grow and the effects the world has not recovered from until today.</p><h2>Revival in the post-Bible era</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49443c94193f87a8.png><p class=align-left>The first revival in the post-Bible era is known as the First Great Awakening. It took place in the United States of America in the early 1700s. This awakening produced an upsurge in the devotion among the Protestants in the 1730's and 1740s. The First Great Awakening also left a permanent mark on Christianity in America until today. The revival occurred as a result of an authoritative preaching of the gospel of Christ that led to many people becoming aware of their personal guilt and the awesome nature and power of saving grace of Christ. The revival also broke Christians away from the ceremonial and ritualistic practice of Christianity (e.g. seeing Christianity as just carrying Bible and going to church every Sunday and other practices) to a deep and personal desire for a relationship for Jesus Christ.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/147fe00d1618807d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Let these powerful Bible verses about joy fill your heart with delight!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There have been many other revivals after the First Great Awakening. Till date, many churches and evangelists hold revival meetings to inspire and reenergize active members of a church body or a community towards a personal commitment to God and to gain new converts.</p><h2>What are the signs of a truly revived church?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4g654sg3kui.jpg><p class=align-left>The evidence of a true spiritual revival in a church that has experienced a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the believers is changed lives. There will be a great movement towards righteousness, love, humility, and evangelism. People will be convicted of their sins, confessing and repenting from them. Believers will spend more time reading and meditating on the word of God, living in obedience to the word of God and spending time in prayers. And Christians will manifest spiritual gifts in love.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Pastor Adeboye biography</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKAkG9pb2Wnna61edGeraKukaF6pLTUq5qhZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2023-ex-plateau-governors-son-jang-gets-pdp-form-for-reps.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ex Plateau Governor's Son, Jang Gets PDP Form For Reps">&larr;
