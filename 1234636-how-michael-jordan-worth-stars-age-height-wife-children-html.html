He is the son of Deloris, a bank employee, and James R. Jordan Sr., an equipment supervisor. Jordan is one of the <a href=#>NBA's greatest legends</a>, and his name will forever be synonymous with the best basketball player.</p><h2>What is Michael Jordan's net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>According to <a id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nba/michael-jordan-net-worth/#how-michael-jordan-became-a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Michael Jordan's net worth is $2.2 billion, making him the highest-paid athlete in history.

MJ's most stable sources of revenue are his Nike/Jordan Brand endorsement deals, valued at around $60 million per year, and his stake in the Charlotte Hornets.</p><p class=align-left>During his career, he earned $90 million in compensation and $1.8 billion from corporate partners such as Nike, Hanes, and Gatorade. Besides, the man still has sponsorship agreements with Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck, which also contribute to the increase in his earnings.</p><h3>What made Jordan a billionaire?</h3><p class=align-left>The NBA legend Michael Jordan acquired a majority stock holding in the Hornets in 2010, but it turned out that he was less successful as a club owner than on the basketball court. Jordan won the champion title six times as a member of the Chicago Bulls, but the Hornets never won a playoff match under his supervision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6bacad239a239ef.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite the setbacks, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the Hornets </a>turned out to be an extremely successful investment for the athlete. In 2006, Jordan was a minority shareholder of the club before paying about $175 million for the team in 2010 and promised to send tens of millions of dollars to <a href=#>future</a> transaction costs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4191b8d655a1dbd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sega to buy Angry Birds maker Rovio</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Forbes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated the team</a> at $1.05 billion, including $150 million in debt. The rise in the team value and the continued success of the Jordan Brand from Nike in 2018 increased his fortune to $1.65 billion.</p><p class=align-left>Before the Hornets, his fortune consisted of what he had earned during his career in the NBA, especially sponsorship contracts. Michael earned $90 million in fifteen years he spent as a player.</p><p class=align-left>He remained the highest-paid NBA player in just two seasons of his career. He made another $1.4 billion thanks to contracts with corporations since he became a professional player in 1984, including his income after leaving the <a href=#>sport</a>.</p><h3>How much did MJ pay for the Hornets?</h3><p class=align-left>Michael paid $180 million in cash for Bob Johnson's 80% stake in the team in 2010. He became the first ex-player to possess a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">majority stake</a> in an NBA team. The Hornets are now worth $1.3 billion.
