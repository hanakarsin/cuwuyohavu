Is Tilted Towers actually coming back? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><p>Epic Games deserves a ton of credit. In just a matter of a few years, the company has been able to establish <a href=#>Fortnite</a> as one of the most globally played and recognized games in the world. They were able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take on Apple in court and win</a>, and have managed to create a title that folks all around the world can play together on a variety of different devices.</p><p>But a lot of it has to do with the psychology of their user base, and many are eagerly asking if Tilted Towers is coming back to the island.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Tilted Towers coming back to 'Fortnite'? It has been gone for quite a while.</h2><p>It's hard not to respect Epic's willingness to implement such massive changes to Fortnite while keeping the spirit of the game intact. It's a brilliant way to keep gamers engaged and to constantly evolve the Battle Royale title.</p><p>It never feels like a stagnant title, and while the core mechanics haven't been altered too much, having a Battle Pass for the title really does seem like you've got access to a new game for as long as Epic decides to be in the Fortnite business.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>One of the biggest changes that gamers see in the title, and one that's implemented across different chapters and major season events, are stark map changes.</p><p>Sometimes these alterations result in popular in-game landmarks, like Tilted Towers, becoming utterly destroyed. This is exactly what happened to the fixture on the May 4, 2019, unvaulting event. A volcano wrecked the Tilted Towers and they haven't been back since.</p><p>Then, at the end of Chapter 2, the island's map literally flipped on itself, which set the course for the new map upgrade at the start of Chapter 3.</p><p>Some eagle-eyed fans took it upon themselves to map out the snow-covered bit of the map and discovered something huge. In their investigations, they were able to outline shapes beneath the powder. Those shapes turned out to be some buildings that appeared to have the same footprint as the Tilted Towers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On Jan. 18, 2022, it was revealed that Tilted Towers was hidden under the snow and ice all along.</h2><p>The latest patch update for Fortnite on Jan. 18, 2022, confirmed exactly what fans had been speculating since the snow and ice encroached on a large part of the island. Tilted Towers was hidden underneath deep layers of frost all along. Now, the map location has returned in all of its original glory, promising to be the central hub of action on the map as it was for years in Fortnite's earlier days.</p><p>Tilted Towers isn't the only addition that the Fortnite patch v19.10 introduced to the game, however. The other major change was the inclusion of a new in-game element: Klombos, giant creatures that wander around and can be used for transportation. Be warned though, as the Klombos can get aggressive if provoked.</p><p>Klomberries were also added to the game, edible fruit that can be used to calm an enraged Klombo as well as procure gifts from a calm one.</p><p>Patch v19.10 also unvaulted the grenade launcher as a playable weapon, bringing back all of the hilarity that weapon brings about within the game.</p><p>Fortnite is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and the Epic Games App on Android. The Android version can be accessed via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortnite.com/Android</a> as well as on the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMilq56cXam8uLHRrGScp52eu6h5wZqapGWkpHqnu9GtpaKslQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1234636-how-michael-jordan-worth-stars-age-height-wife-children-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Jordan's net worth: what made him a billionaire?">&larr;
