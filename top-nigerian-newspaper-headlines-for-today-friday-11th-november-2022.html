style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Friday, 11th November 2022</h2><p>The Nigerian Railway Corporation has said that the National Identity Number will now become compulsory for passenger profiling when boarding the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service.</p><p>The Managing Director of the Corporation, Fidet Okhiria made this known during an interview on Arise TV on Thursday.</p><p>The NIN, which is no longer optional according to the NRC boss is part of the new security measures adopted by the government.</p><p>The announcement was made a week after the Minister of Transport announced the resumption of train service along the Abuja-Kaduna route after it was suspended in March this year.</p><p>He said the system will ask for NIN to ensure the person buying the ticket is buying for the person that is actually traveling.</p><p>For visitors, the NRC boss said someone with NIN must be able to identify the person.</p><p>He said that the number of Police, Civil Defense, and Military personnel would also be increased.</p><p>The Inspector General Police, Usman Alkali-Baba has revealed that some of the abducted Chibok girls who recently returned and reunited with their families have expressed willingness to return to their captors.</p><p>The IGP made this known while speaking on the status of internal security at the weekly briefings coordinated by the Presidential Media Team in Abuja.</p><p>According to IGP baba, some of the abducted girls, especially those who were forced into marriage and had children for their captors only returned to see their families.</p><p>The Anambra State Governor, Charles Soludo has declared that the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) will not support the 2023 presidential ambition of the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Peter Obi.</p><p>Though Obi is from Anambra State, and a former Governor, he is not part of the current ruling party in his state which is APGA, Naija News observed.</p><p>Soludo said because APGA has its own presidential candidate, though they wish Obi well, it is not possible to support him against their own party’s candidate.</p><p>The Anambra State Governor was quoted to have made his stand known in a recent statement through his Special Adviser on Political Matters, Dr Alex Obiogbolu.</p><p>He observed that supporting Obi would automatically mean working against the APGA presidential candidate, Peter Umeadi.</p><p>The Governor noted that Labour Party is not a threat to APGA as those who should feel threatened about the obidient movement are members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because LP is an off shoot of PDP.</p><p>According to him, APGA is in the race to win and further expand its coverage as a major political party in Nigeria.</p><p>The federal government of Nigeria says it is closely monitoring developments and happenings on the popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter following its takeover by Elon Musk.</p><p>The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed made this known on Thursday in Abuja during the ministerial press briefing.</p><p>He pointed out that the government is not considering banning Twitter again in Nigeria but won’t allow the platform or any social media platform to be used to undermine the integrity of the country or cause problems.</p><p>Mohammed added that the resolve of the government to prevent any social media platform from being used to spread fake news, disinformation, and hate speech in Nigeria remains in place.</p><p>The Minister said the government will however continue to engage with the different social media platforms, including Facebook, Google (owners of YouTube), and Twitter.</p><p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has recorded another property loss as some unknown hoodlums set one of its facilities in Osun State on fire.</p><p>Reports obtained by Naija News revealed that the arsonists invaded the commission’s office in Oke-Iresi, Ede South Local Government Area of the state on Thursday and lit it up.</p><p>The State Fire Service was said to have responded swiftly to the scene to prevent the fire from spreading to other offices.</p><p>The incident has been confirmed by Festus Okoye, INEC, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee and the Osun Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Mutiu Agboke.</p><p>In a signed press statement, Okoye disclosed that the Nigerian Police and other security agencies have been informed of the incident and have commenced a full investigation.</p><p>Exhibits recovered from the scene of the incident include leftovers of the bread bomb, a face cap and a gallon of petrol.</p><p>The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has criticized Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State over a recent statement against Nigerians of Fulani origin.</p><p>Recall that Ortom, last Sunday, while playing host to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) G5 Governors in Benue State, said he would not be supporting the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>Ortom said he would not support Atiku, who is not concerned about the continuous killings of the Benue people.</p><p>The Benue State Governor, while lamenting the killing of people in his local government last week, said, “to hell with Atiku and anyone supporting him.”</p><p>He noted that anyone supporting the presidential ambition of Atiku in 2023 is an enemy of Benue State.</p><p>The governor also accused Fulani herders of killing some villagers in the state and vowing not to support a Fulani as president.</p><p>Ortom has, however, made a public apology after his viral statement.</p><p>Reacting through a statement, NEF’s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, warned politicians to refrain from politicizing insecurity, especially communal conflicts.</p><p>While demanding that killers of villagers in Benue State and other citizens in other villages in many parts of the North must be traced and prosecuted, Baba-Ahmed acknowledged that rogue Fulani elements have stood out as killers, bandits, and kidnappers in the north.</p><p>He said the forum, like other Nigerians, watched the video in which Governor Ortom spoke in a manner and language totally unbecoming of a leader.</p><p>The National Chairman of the Nigeria Legion, Abdulmalik Jibril on Wednesday revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari and some retired soldiers will receive the “Green Heroes Award” for their roles during the civil war in the country.</p><p>Jibril who revealed this in the Federal Capital Territory while addressing newsmen noted that the retired soldiers would be honoured for their sacrifice.</p><p>Others on the list are former Heads of State, Generals Yakubu Gowon, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Minister of Defence, General T.Y. Danjuma (rtd).</p><p>Jibril who was represented by the chairman of the Nigerian Legion Green Hero Foundation awards, Shehu Yusuf said, “About 55 years ago, Nigeria fought a civil war (War of Unity) to ensure that the nation remains one entity with the hope of ensuring unity and faith, peace and progress. The war ended in 1970 with a no victor, no vanquish declaration.</p><p>“The efforts of the Armed Forces were thereafter directed at projecting Nigeria’s image positively across the globe. In view of the foregoing, the Nigerian Legion in partnership with the Green Heroes Foundation intends to commence a process of appreciating our soldiers yearly with a yearly Nigerian Legion/Green Heroes Foundation Honours and Awards ceremony.</p><p>“The event will also afford us the opportunity to appreciate the steadfastness of our widows and provide some succour to some of the orphans.”</p><p>A spokesperson of the Labour Party (LP) presidential campaign, Dele Farotimi has expressed concern over the absence of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu from debates.</p><p>Farotimi on Thursday said Tinubu has been dodging debates outside his control ahead of the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>He noted that the debates are put in place for critical members of the public to ask questions of the presidential candidates.</p><p>Farotimi further stated that Tinubu despite the call to attend presidential debates has been escaping interrogation.</p><p>The spokesman vowed to wear Tinubu’s campaign cap for as long as this season lasts if the presidential candidate dares to attend any of the debates.</p><p>Farotimi stated this on Thursday morning while fielding questions on Arise TV’s morning show.</p><p>He added that anytime the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi submit himself for debate, Tinubu would be represented by Kashim Shettima, his running mate.</p><p>Farotimi noted that in the case of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, he would be represented by Ifeanyi Okowa.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu has promised to create one million jobs in the first two years of his government if elected as president at next year’s polls.</p><p>Naija News reports that former Lagos deputy governor, Femi Pedro gave the promise in Abuja on Thursday at a one-day public symposium theme: “Dissecting the Asiwaju Manifesto – Renewed Hope 2023.”</p><p>According to him, the pledge by the APC presidential hopeful was contained in his 80-page manifesto titled ‘Renewed Hope.’</p><p>Pedro, while explaining Tinubu’s 80-page action plan noted that there were 12 key economic points to get Nigeria out of its current economic woes.</p><p>The former governor listed part of the key point to bring back manufacturing companies like Dunlop that left the country many years ago, resuscitate the commodity boards, empower women, expand infrastructure provision and curtail the run-away inflation, among others.</p><p>The APC had organized the one-day talk show to have a public engagement of the 80-page action plan for a better Nigeria of the party’s presidential candidate.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi has vowed to turn Nigeria around if elected as the country’s leader in 2023.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday in Aba, Abia State during the flag-off of his party’s governorship campaign in the southeast state, Obi promised to make Nigeria better.</p><p>The event held at the Ngwa High School field in Osisioma local government area had many Labour Party chieftains in attendance including the Abia governorship candidate, Alex Otti.</p><p>The former Anambra State Governor speaking at the campaign lamented the years of decay and wrong leadership Nigeria has suffered under previous administrations and promised to right the wrongs.</p><p>Obi observed that Aba which used to be a commercial nerve centre is fast declining as businesses are shutting down. He however promised to resuscitate the ailing industries not only in Aba but in other parts of Nigeria and make the business environment conducive for new ones to spring up.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
