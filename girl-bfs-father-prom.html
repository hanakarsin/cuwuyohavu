We all want that day to be as far as possible from all of us, which is why it's always especially tragic when someone young passes away.</p><p>Sadly, Carter Brown's parents had to endure that tragedy when they learned their 19-year-old son was involved in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fatal car crash</a>.</p><p>He was driving from Indiana State University back to his hometown in Pennyslavania to surprise his girlfriend, Kaylee Sauders, a month before her senior prom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: sinclairstoryonline</a></figure><p>Kaylee, along with Carter's family were devastated by the news. How does one react to the sudden loss of somebody, especially a person you were in love with?</p><p>Understandably, Kaylee wasn't interested in attending her senior prom, but Carter's father didn't want her to miss such an important moment in her life. So he came up with a brilliant idea.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>Carter's father asked Kaylee if he could take her to the prom so they could both honor the memory of Carter and so she wouldn't have to miss her special day.</p><p>She immediately accepted, and the whole thing was incredibly touching.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure>"I didn't have to think about it. I definitely said 'yes'," Kaylee told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre Daily Times</a>.<p>Kaylee went on to say that if it wasn't for Carter's dad making the suggestion, she would've never thought to attend prom.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure>"It meant a lot that he kind of stepped up and took the role, because it was my senior prom and I didn't want to go any more," she said.<p>Carter's father made sure that Kaylee got a full pre-prom photoshoot experience as well. He started it off by rolling up in his car to pick her up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>For them to have something to smile and laugh about under the circumstances is amazing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>They got all of the prom poses down pat: you've got the car shots.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>Along with the obligatory ridiculous stances.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>When the photographer says, "let's do a silly one" you want to roll your eyes, but come on, it's basically a prom tradition.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>Carter's mother, Kelly O'Neil, shared the photos on her Facebook account with a funny and touching message.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She's super proud of her husband and was struck by the beautiful gesture he came up with to both honor their son and ensure Kaylee got to attend her senior prom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure>"He's truly amazing, he is a gift. Carter was in college. He wasn't super excited about going to a high school prom, but he was excited about doing that for Kaylee. ... Rob didn't like the idea of Kaylee not getting that."<p>Carter's father was basically making good on a promise that his son made to Kaylee, and the idea of a father doing that for his son, so soon after his passing, is enough to make you think people are chopping onions in the room.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>When Kaylee arrived at prom with Carter's dad, everyone thought it was a beautiful gesture.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>The Browns, unfortunately, have dealt with a lot of tragedy as of late.</p><p>Just seven months prior, in September 2017, their oldest son, Christopher Brown, passed away at just 23 years old.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure>"We lost Chris in September. Seven months apart, it's an awful lot. This gave us something to be excited about. So that was also kind of a gift to have something fun to look forward to. It was big deal for all of us."<p>For Kaylee and the Brown family, her senior prom was an event to get excited about after such terrible losses.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>We can't control what happens in our lives for the most part, but we can control our reactions.
