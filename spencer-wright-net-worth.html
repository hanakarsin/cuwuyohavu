The rodeo master joined the professional scene in 2010, and within five years he was already the world champion. Throughout his career, Spencer has taken home hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnings — proving rodeo can be a very lucrative way to provide for a family. But what is Spencer's net worth?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Spencer Wright's net worth?</h2><p>Though Spencer's notoriety as a rodeo contestant has earned him plenty of notoriety, fame doesn't always equal wealth — and unfortunately, it's not clear what the athlete's net worth is. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Rodeo</a>, throughout his career, Spencer has earned a whopping $1,129,833 from his time in rodeo — but that doesn't necessarily equal his net worth.</p><p>Spencer first came onto the rodeo scene in 2010, and in his first year, he took home a measly $3,098. Each year, depending on his performance, his earnings would fluctuate — meaning that an average of his total earnings over the course of his career also wouldn't be an appropriate estimate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@officialspencerwright</a></figure><p>That said, for much of his career, Spencer has earned anywhere from five to six figures in a season. His most lucrative year was in 2014, when he took home $205,388. This was also the year he snagged the world title, and it took quite a few competitions for him to cash in those earnings.</p><p>According to his profile on Pro Rodeo, that year he won the Mother Lode Round-Up, the Mountain Valley Stampede, the Magic Valley Stampede, the Othello PRCA Rodeo, the Poway Rodeo, and was named a co-champion at the Rooftop Rodeo and the Arcadia All-Florida Championship Rodeo. He also placed in nine out of 10 rounds at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo that year, further raking in the winnings.</p><p>But despite securing six figures that year, Spencer only earned $86,454 in 2015 and $20,736 in 2016, further proving that his income is subject to some significant fluctuation. While we can acknowledge his massive career earnings, we can't estimate how much he's worth at this moment. Spencer has not publicly shared how he spends his earnings, if he saves them to be budgeted over the years or if any of his money is tied up in real estate. Because of this, it's not possible to know his net worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>(L-R) Stetson Wright, Jesse Wright, Ryder Wright, Rusty Wright, Spencer Wright and Cody Wright at the National Finals Rodeo</p></figure><p>At this time, his winnings for the 2024 season haven't been shared, but in 2023 he only snagged $48,684 in earnings, placing 35th in the world of rodeo. As he's currently sponsored by Express Ranches, according to his Instagram bio, it's likely he earns an additional annual income from that, though the exact numbers aren't made publicly available.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Spencer Wright has been doing rodeo since he was in high school.</h2><p>According to his bio, Spencer has been an avid member of the rodeo community since he was in high school. In 2008, he was named the National High School Saddle Bronc Riding champion, while he achieved the NIRA saddle bronc riding champion for the College of Southern Idaho in 2013.</p><p>In 2014, Spencer's family was spotlighted that rodeo season, as he and three of his brothers all qualified for the NFR that year. Rodeo has been a family event for his family, as all of his older brothers also compete.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2musKeqWavop60qcCMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zahra-elise-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zahra Elise - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
