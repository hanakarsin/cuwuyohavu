Section 134 (2) of the Constitution makes it mandatory that an election to the office of the President be held on a date not earlier than 180 days and not later than 30 days before the expiration of the term of office of the last holder of that office.”</p><p>Okoye explained that constitutionally and legally, no one, not even a court of law has the right or the vice to extend the time assigned by the constitution, adding that the time cannot be extended, expanded, elongated, or otherwise enlarged.</p><p>The INEC’s national commissioner continued that “The time fixed by the Constitution is like the rock of Gibraltar or Mount Zion, which cannot be moved. If what is to be done is not done within the time fixed, it lapses as the court is thereby robbed of the jurisdiction to continue to entertain the matter.</p><p>“Any suggestion relating to the postponement of elections, rescheduling of elections or tampering with the constitutional timelines may lead to constitutional challenges. We must all work assiduously to ensure that the election holds at the time and period designated by the constitution,” he added.</p><p>Reiterating<strong><a href=# rel=noopener> INEC</a>‘s</strong> core responsibility, Okoye said the commission’s focus is just to conduct and supervise elections, and not the provision of security.</p><p>He however pointed out that the Nigerian Police Force, which is the lead agency in charge of election security has promised the commission to work hand in hand with other security agencies to provide security during the election.</p><p>Okoye furthered that the police force has also assured both the commission and Nigerians to tackle and reduce security challenges to the bearest minimum ahead of the elections and during and after.</p><p>Speaking on the issue of challenges the commission might encounter at the poll, He said “The conduct and delivery of elections is a multi-stakeholder venture and requires the cooperation, coordination, and harmonious involvement of the political parties, the security agencies, the media, and all the critical stakeholders in the electoral process. It is next to impossible for one agency to cover the field without the active cooperation of the others. We expect the security agencies to prepare and prepare well.</p><p>“We expect the political parties to prepare and prepare well. The candidates in the election must develop a democratic spirit and conduct their campaigns and rallies in a manner that elevates rather than diminishes the electoral process. Nigerians expect a good election and the commission is determined to deliver it. Yes, there are serious concerns and challenges in different parts of the country. These are significant challenges. Nigerians want to vote and need a secure environment to make their free choice.</p><p>“Based on this, political parties and candidates in the election must, as a matter of national security, tone down their rhetoric and create a democratic ce that gives confidence to the people rather than compounds the existing security challenges in the country through unguarded utterances.”</p><p>Given his take on the procurement of sensitive material and other equipment, Okoye noted that “These are ballot papers and result sheets. We can only print the ballot papers when we ascertain the number of registered voters that will participate in the 2023 general election. We estimate that the figure may hover around 95 million.</p><p>” So, it is too early to ascertain the number of ballot papers and result sheets that will be printed and their cost. We must conclude the printing of the Permanent Voters Cards, carry out the display of the register for claims and objections, and make available the Permanent Voters Cards for collection before a determination will be made on the number of ballot papers and result sheets that will be printed.</p><p>“The commission has gone far in procuring sensitive and non-sensitive materials required for the conduct of the 2023 general election. These materials are being delivered to various locations in preparation for the election. The ballot boxes and voting cubicles are being delivered to the location. Mats, generating sets, and GP tanks required for our Registration Area Centres are being delivered. Observers’ kits, media paraphernalia, stamps, stamp pads, tamper-proof jackets and other things needed for the election are being delivered.</p><p>“We are confident that we will complete the procurement of materials based on our timelines. The commission is brainstorming and designing creative and innovative strategies to procure intervention vehicles during the election,” the INEC national commissioner noted.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong></a> learnt that Okoye, who told Nigerians to see the 2023 general election as a festival of democracy, urged them to be vigilant and also take part in the election because the conduction of a free, fair and transparent election is not possible without the engagement of an active citizenry.</p><p>He said Nigerians should not also forget that the international community is watching because Nigeria’s democracy matters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FwZmtoYmh6prjEnKuip55isKK602aZnmWjqbyxvMSdZKiqXaW8tMDPqKWenF2XsqSt1KycZqeWYravv8ScrKuhpK56sLfOspxo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./234002-aliyekuwa-mkuu-wa-recce-squad-akiasi-chama-cha-jubilee-na-kuungana-na-nasa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aliyekuwa mkuu wa RECCE SQUAD akiasi chama cha Jubilee na kuungana na NASA">&larr;
