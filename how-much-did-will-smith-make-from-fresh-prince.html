He was likely paid at least $2.8 million for the first three seasons of the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Season 1 of <a href=#>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a><strong> </strong>premiered on Sept. 10, 1990,<strong> </strong>on NBC, and it became an instant hit among sitcom fans.</p><p>The classic TV show helped actors like Tatyana Ali<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Alfonso Ribeiro earn international fame. What some fans might not be aware of, however, is that The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air allowed <a href=#>Will Smith</a> to get out of serious financial trouble. When he got the show, he owed a whopping $2.8 million to the IRS. How much did Will Smith end up making from the show?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Smith was out of debt by the the time Season 3 of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' finished.</h2><p>Will became a successful rapper before he landed the lead role on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to his work as a musician, he was able to splurge on luxury goods — but he wasn't paying his taxes. Reportedly, by the time Will joined the cast of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, most of his assets had been repossessed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Will got involved with the show after he reached rock bottom financially.&nbsp;As he revealed during an appearance on the YouTube series Storytime, things began to spiral downward because he became too accustomed to his opulent lifestyle. As an award-winning rapper, he felt compelled to maintain a façade — and he failed to budget for his taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had spent all my money, and I didn't forget, but I didn't pay the IRS," he said. "In my mind, I wasn't trying to avoid paying taxes. I was just like, 'Ah damn, they need their money,'" Will explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Desperate to get out of his dire financial situation, Will started to hang out near The Arsenio Hall Show<strong> </strong>studio in Los Angeles at his then-girlfriend's recommendation — and, miraculously enough, the strategy worked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Will met Quincy Jones, the executive producer of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, who invited him back to his house for a brief discussion and an impromptu audition. Within months, the pilot of the show was underway, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Philadelphia Inquirer.</a></p><p>However, Will's troubles with the IRS were far from over. Seventy percent of Will's salary was garnished until the debt was completely paid off, a milestone Will says he hit roughly around the same time Season 3 came to an end.&nbsp;</p><p>"For the first three years of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, the IRS was taking 70 percent of every check and after the third year, I got back to zero. It's terrible to have that kind of success and have to quietly be broke," Will said on 60 Minutes (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebrityNetWorth</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>"Being famous and broke is a s--t combination because you’re still famous and people recognize you, but they recognize you while you’re sitting next to them on the bus," Will said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>However, the story has a happy ending. Having struggled to pay off the debt, Will decided to approach his finances with a new mentality. Currently, his estimated net worth is $350 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it's unknown how much he may have gotten paid for his appearance in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, one thing is certain: Will has achieved incredible success since the 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllJ6xbsPIpaNmq52ewal5zJqinmWWp7yuecWrnKygXaW%2FqrrCng%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./details-of-obasanjos-meeting-with-obi-wike-emerge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Details Of Obasanjo's Meeting With Obi, Wike Emerge">&larr;
