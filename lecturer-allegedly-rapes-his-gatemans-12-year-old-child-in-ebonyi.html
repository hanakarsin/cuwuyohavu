Reports have it that the victim, a native of Ezza North Local Government Area of the state was living under the same roof with the suspect, as her biological father serves as a gateman of the house.</p><p>A source who reportedly shared more light into the incident with the PUNCH on condition of anonymity, said, “An alleged child violator, Felix Anyaegbunam, a professor of Geophysics working with Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo, in Ebonyi State, is now in the police net. He is from Anambra state. His wife is also a professor at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and most of his children are Doctoral Degree holders according to research.</p><p>“A few days ago, a whistleblower brought a report against the professor leading to his arrest and detention yesterday by the police. He is being accused of constant <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>sexual abuse</strong></a> on the 12-year-old daughter of his gateman.”</p><p>The source further revealed that the victim has been rescued and is currently receiving proper medical examination at a hospital.</p><p>Sharing her awful experience living under the same roof with her violator, the young girl whose name is withheld for security purposes told newsmen in an interview that the suspect, <strong>Anyaegbunam, </strong>have abused her sexually for more than six months.</p><p>“I was living in the village with my mother. My daddy brought me to live with Prof in Abakaliki. Since June this year, the Prof has been disturbing me. He always comes into my room and does what I don’t like,”&nbsp;PUNCH Metro quoted the girl as saying.</p><p>She continued: “One day around 2aam, I ran to my father at the security house and told him that Prof was pressing my breast. My father told me to go back that he will talk with him in the morning. Sometimes, I will wake up and see myself naked.</p><p>“The other day, somebody was touching me at midnight. I woke up, put on the light and saw Prof lying on my bed naked. He tried to touch me but I slapped him and pushed him out of my room. I was crying.</p><p>“One day, I woke up and my bed was soaked with blood. I didn’t know what happened. I told my father in the morning but he didn’t do anything. He used to tell me that if I leave Prof’s house, who will pay my school fees? That is how the Prof has continued to disturb me until I told my aunty in the school because I don’t like that nonsense Prof is doing.”</p><p>Confirming the report, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs Loveth Odah said that the Commissioner of Police, Mr <strong>Aliyu Garba</strong> had been informed of the incident and has ordered a discreet investigation into the matter.</p><p>Mrs Odah said, “The suspect of the alleged case of rape is in Police custody now. The CP has ordered a discreet investigation into the matter, we are while awaiting the medical screening/report of the victim.”</p><p>However, <strong>Naija News</strong> in an attempt to get to the root of the alleged sexual assault involving the said lecturer reached out to the institution for confirmation.</p><p>The Public Relations Officer of the university, Elom Iyke who spoke on the telephone with our correspondent, said the university was just informed of the incident on Sunday morning.</p><p>He, however, promised to get back to us on the incident as soon as possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FqZqWdk6nCs7HRZpilpJWcsqW42GapmqiVqHqptdJmnpqslaKur7%2BMamlmsZWWv267y51knKCZobFutc1mnJunnq62cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kayode-egbetokun.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read All The Latest News About Kayode Egbetokun On Naija News">&larr;
