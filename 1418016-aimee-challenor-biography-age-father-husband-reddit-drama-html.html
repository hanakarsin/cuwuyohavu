She was raised in Coventry, a town in the West Midlands parts of England. As of 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aimee Challenor's age</a> is 23 years.</p><p class=align-left>She has two younger siblings. One of her siblings is also <a href=#>a transgender woman</a>.</p><h3>Childhood</h3><p class=align-left>The former UK politician <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">struggled with her gender</a> identity from a young age. Here is what she had to say about her coming out:</p>It struck me when I was about 10 or 11 that I was a girl. I couldn’t put my finger on it but something wasn’t right. I was in year 6 and I left my parents a letter on their bed before I went to school one morning. When we talked about it later, they were very supportive, but no one knew what trans was. So, I went back into the closet.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c2eb116bf2fe0375.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blaire White’s bio: age, height, fiance, transition, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aimee has had a turbulent childhood. At the age of 4, she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diagnosed with autism</a>. In 2013, together with her two siblings, she was taken into care after the social services expressed concern about her parents.</p><p class=align-left>In February 2013, at the age of 15, she was arrested after she threatened to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">launch a cyber-attack </a>on the Birmingham Bullring Shopping Centre. After disagreements with security guards during a tax evasion protest, Mrs. Knight claimed that she was part of the internet activists' group Anonymous. However, no charges were ever brought as the case was dismissed.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>As for her <a href=#>education</a>, Challenor was enrolled at Lewis Charlton Learning Centre, a school for children with special needs. She later joined Henley College Coventry. She holds a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from the Open University. She has also served as a representative of the National Union of Student as well as LGBTQ+ officer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52befdd24a115e31.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Addie Andrews' biography: age, real name, career, early life</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Challenor joined politics in 2014 when she joined the Green Party of England and Wales.

In 2017, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">helped co-found</a> the Global Greens LGBT+ Network, which aimed at putting trans and intersex recognition and rights into law.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>transgender activist</a> has also vied for a political sit. Back in 2017, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contested for a position</a> as a representative in Coventry South, which is a constituency in the West Midlands of the UK. Out of the total votes cast, she received 604 votes which represented 1.3% votes cast. She ranked 5th out of the six candidates who vied for the seat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9ea0d0d81c9b03ef.png><p class=align-left>In 2018, Aimee was suspended from her position in The Green Party after investigations were lobbied against her father. Her father<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> was first charged</a> in November 2016. After David's case came to light, The Green Party said that it was not aware of his arrest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/de2babbd3e4d0b9b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Chloe Khan's biography: age, ethnicity, net worth, before and after</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The party apologized because he was an election agent who represented his daughter in both local and the general elections. Aimee Challenor's father was found guilty in August 2018 and jailed for 22 years for child sex offenses.</p><p class=align-left>Aimee has also been a member of the Liberal Democrats party, where she served as a Diversity Officer. However, she was dismissed from her position due to controversial posts that her husband made on his social media.</p><h2>Who is Aimee Challenor's husband?</h2><p class=align-left>The ex-<a href=#>UK politician</a> is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married to her husband</a>, Nathaniel Knight. The couple got married in 2019.</p><h2>Aimee Challenor's Reddit drama</h2><p class=align-left>Reddit recently announced that Aimee was no longer working for them after thousands of users called for her to be removed as the admin from the popular forum.

Nathaniel's posts on Twitter back in 2019 did not sit well with Reddit users. He once posted that he had sexual fantasies involving children and torture. Aimee went on to defend her husband, saying that the tweets did not represent her husband's opinion. This is what she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had to say</a>:</p>The tweets that were purported to appear on my partner’s account were not his thoughts or opinions. He deleted the tweets as soon as he could. Because they are under investigation, I cannot comment too much on him.<p class=align-left>In their defense, Reddit stated that they had not adequately vetted the ex-politician before hiring her.</p><p class=align-left>After her dismissal from Reddit, Aimee Challenor has kept a low profile away from the public eye.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Misiak's biography: age, height, boyfriend, acting career</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/94954caa6a92f849.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Jade Tailor bio: age, height, ethnicity, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng</a> recently published an article on <a href=#>Taylor Misiak</a>.
