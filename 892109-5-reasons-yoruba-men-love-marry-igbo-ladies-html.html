Despite all these, couples still find a way of sealing the gap between the torn families with their love.</p><p>Yoruba and Igbo are two major tribes in Nigeria. Both are powerful and represent a large portion of the population. There is an interaction between them just like with any other tribe in Nigeria, However, when the issue of marriage comes into play they handle it with sentiments.</p><p>There are certain qualities possessed by ladies who are Igbo. Just like each tribe has its own peculiarities, there are some things that are synonymous to Igbo women. They are basically important things one has to know before marrying an Igbo woman. This would help the relationship to thrive well and would help them reduce the chances of getting divorced.</p><p>Yoruba men who fall in &nbsp;love with Igbo ladies must have seen some of these traits and qualities in the women before deciding to marry them. They know the battle they have to fight with that desire of theirs yet they are not discouraged.</p><p>As liberal as a family could be, the members would always express their desire for their sons and daughters to marry within the clan or tribe. They would only accept the proposal in order not to ruin the happiness of their children.</p><p>Find below some of the reasons why Yoruba men marry Igbo ladies:</p><p class=h3>1. Igbo women are home builders</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3mphtu6nd82g.jpeg><p>It would be nice for us not to be sentimental when considering this issue.

At this point, they have no control over the person their hearts choose. Not giving in to love may subject them to a lifetime of unhappiness at the long run.</p><p>Moreover, they do not marry these ladies by force, there is usually a strong mutual consent by the parties involved as it is essential for them to work as a unit in order to gain the support of their family members.</p><p class=h3>4.
