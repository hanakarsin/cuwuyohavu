They need our support to motivate them more.”</p><p>Adepoju Adetayo also commended the Nigerian troops, asking God to bless them for winning the war against terrorism in Nigeria.</p><p>While Adex Adeyemi said:&nbsp;<i>“I know very well that you will gain the victory no matter who their sponsors are.</i></p><p><i>I believe that we’ll all conquer and the souls of our departed heroes smile at your success. By God’s grace, we pray for you to conquer the monsters and come back home in peace and alive.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Boko Haram Agree To Release All 219 Chibok Girls</a></p><p>Douglas Koko said: “<i>bravo to our military men!!! I can see their morale is quite high. Hope they will be able to subdue these blood-thirsty demons and their band of apologists.”</i></p><p>Hamidu Dauda called the Nigerian troops patriotic soldiers begging God to bless them and expose the unpatriotic ones.</p><p>Macdonald Osuagwu prayed:&nbsp;<i>“Oh God, bless our soldiers, strenghten them and give them all it takes to dislodge the insurgents. No peace for Boko Haram sponsors.”</i></p><p>According to Tolu Onagoruwa-George,&nbsp;<i>“may all our enemies– internal and external – be disgraced and defeated,” just as Na-Allah Mohammed Zagga prayed: “may the terrorists continue to drop like flies! The world will be a happier and better place when it is depopulated of evil doers and indiscriminate mass murderers.”</i></p><p>Reacting to the news of Shekau’s death and the treatment of some injured Boko Haram members, Kareem Mufutau Ishola, said:&nbsp;<i>“stop treating injured Boko Haram fighters.</i></p><p><i>Why don’t you let them die like heir cohorts? Of what purpose are you detaining him when at the end of the day government and court of law will not be able to pass judgement on him? Kill them all whenever you capture them, God bless Nigeria.”</i></p><p>Olu Ricketts asked:<i>&nbsp;“are you giving these updates to give us (false) hope? Or to copy the Israelis?”</i></p><p>Abdullahi Adamu asked to be shown evidence of the successes recorded by the Nigerian troops to prove that they killed Shekau, while Nasiru Manga asked: “why not tell us his name instead of saying Boko Haram leader, senior member, kingpin, etc? Of what benefit is the hiding of his identity?”</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Emir Of Kano Explains Why There Is Boko Haram</a></p><p>Tobi Oburumu simply declared: “I’m ashamed that the Nigerian Army is till using AK47 when countries are using modern rifles.”</p><p>In his reaction, Boko Haram Australian negotiator, Stephen Davis, also said the real Shekau had been killed since 2013 as claimed by the Nigerian military.</p><p>He said the member of the sect currently being paraded was only an impostor of the late Shekau to give the impression that Shekau was still alive.</p><p>While congratulating the troops, Alexis Murphy said he still doubted the story about the death of Shekau..</p><p>Ogbonnia Okolo, in his reaction, said:&nbsp;<i>“we’ll keep praying for our soldiers who toil in the most difficult and challenging terrain to defend our country.</i></p><p><i>Once more, I wish to appeal with you and plead that you consider the sentence for the 12 officers court martialed.”</i></p><p>Suleiman Ibn Yusuf said:&nbsp;<i>“kudos to my gallant soldiers. The forces of darkness will not win. Let us use this medium to call for the immediate release of our 12 gallant soldiers and let them return to action.</i></p><p><i>“Do you want Nigerians to believe that you killed over 60 insurgents and recovered only 24 rifles. Were they fighting you with clubs?”</i></p><p>Eucharius Chukwunenye Ofobike asked:<i>&nbsp;“Please where is Ogwuche? Has he been released? I don’t understand why a terrorist leader should be captured and is being given treatment again in a military hospital for heaven’s sake!</i></p><p><i>“Of what benefit will his treatment be? And you have sentenced poor soldiers to death for just protesting for their rights?”</i></p><p>Ajibulu Peter said:&nbsp;<i>“let’s join hands and raise our voice to free those convicted soldiers, bearing in mind that they are human beings with emotions, and emotions give room to anger when frustration sets in.</i></p><p><i>“These soldiers were frustrated with archaic weapons.”</i></p><p>It would be recalled that the Defence Headquarters announced&nbsp;on Monday, 22 September, that <a href=#>ten member of the Boko Haram sect have surrendered to Nigerian troops</a>.</p><p>According to the military body, those who surrendered have been taken into custody for security debriefing.</p><p>The Islamist group is believed to have killed over 5,000 people across Nigeria since 2009.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3qBknJvZqaZnLKztcCnqmaroJqurHnSoZykmaWoeqWxwK2fZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./273426-njama-za-wapinzani-kupaka-tope-jina-langu-hazitafua-dafu-mike-sonko-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Njama za wapinzani kupaka tope jina langu hazitafua dafu - Mike Sonko">&larr;
