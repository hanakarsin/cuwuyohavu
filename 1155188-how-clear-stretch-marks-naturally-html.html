We have prepared lots of recipes you can try at home to make your stretch marks much less noticeable. So strap in and let’s go!</p><h3>Shea butter on stretch marks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt49rm3rm7mbg.jpg><p class=align-left>Shea butter is full of Vitamin A and antioxidants, which are great for improving the elasticity of the skin. If you want to clear your stretch marks, then shea butter should become your best friend! Use only fresh raw shea butter, as it is the most nutritious in its pure state. Here is what you should do with it:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/23c035dda57ebd55.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stanbic IBTC: Is your health as sound as your wealth</span></p></a><li>Gently exfoliate the skin that has stretch marks on it. Try using oatmeal soap or something like that. Do not use any harsh exfoliants, or you might make things worse.</li><li>Wash your hands, scoop some shea butter and rub it between your palms to warm it up. This will make it much easier to apply.</li><li>With firm circular motions, apply the butter to your skin. Massage it in for some time in order for it to sink deeper into the skin.</li><li>Do this treatment up to three times each day to achieve the best results. You should definitely do this before you go to bed, as the skin regenerates while you are sleeping. This way, you will help it to regenerate quicker and more effectively.</li><p class=align-left>Shea butter is a great tool for keeping the skin with stretch marks moisturised and healthy. However, be aware that, just as other remedies, it does not guarantee that the stretch marks will disappear or fade immediately. Be patient, and you will see the results soon enough.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stanbic IBTC Pension: Every ‘Someday’ needs a plan</span></p></a><h2>Coconut oil on stretch marks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/23c035dda57ebd55.jpg><p class=align-left>Another great weapon against those resilient stretch marks is coconut oil.

Repeat the procedure every day.</li><li>You can make a moisturiser out of aloe vera. Get a tablespoon of aloe gel, a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of wheat oil. Mix them together, put the mixture in an old moisturiser bottle or an airtight container and leave it in the fridge for the night.

Other than that, you can safely use these recipes to lighten your stretch marks.</p><p class=align-left>Now that we have told you all sorts of ways you can cure your stretch marks naturally, we want to answer some common questions you might have about stretch marks in general. Check it out!</p><h2>What causes stretch marks?</h2><p class=align-left>Stretch marks have several reasons for appearing:</p><ul><li>If you are a teenager, you might have stretch marks because of growing too fast. Your skin cannot catch up with your growth spurt, so it stretches too thin, thus causing stretch marks to appear.</li><li>The same can be said about rapid gain or loss of weight. If your weight slowly increases or decreases, your skin can adapt to the changes pretty easily. However, if you gain or lose kilograms very quickly, the skin loses its elasticity, which is why stretch marks appear.</li><li>Pregnant people suffer from stretch marks more often than others do. As the body has to accustom to carrying a living thing inside of it, not all of its parts can catch up in time. That is why when the belly grows and the breasts fill up, the skin sometimes cannot handle the pressure.</li><li>Stretch marks are also a result of having the increased levels of cortisone in the body. Cortisone is a naturally produced hormone that comes from the adrenal glands. If a person has Marfan’s syndrome, Cushing’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or any other syndrome that affects the adrenal gland, they might get stretch marks.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0ff6b11d006a9f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best and amazing tips on how to impress a girl</span></p></a><h2>How prevent stretch marks during pregnancy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9da79168c0c6d0d4.jpg><p class=align-left>There is no proven way that will definitely help you to avoid getting stretch marks during pregnancy. However, here are a few tips that might help to minimise the chances of getting them. Here they are:</p><ul><li><strong>Eat right.</strong> Have a proper diet with balanced meals. Make sure you are getting enough vitamins A and E, as well as omega 3s and antioxidants.</li><li><strong>Do not forget to exercise while you are pregnant.</strong> It will help your skin to keep it elasticity and keep your weight in check. Speaking of…</li><li><strong>Watch your weight.</strong> Eating for two does not mean eating twice as much food as you normally do.</li><li><strong>Stay hydrated. </strong>While it is always important to drink plenty of water, it is absolutely essential during pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Stay away from harsh chemicals.</strong> Look out for sulphates that might be hiding in your bottle of body wash. You can use a cleanser with natural oils as a much healthier alternative.</li><li><strong>Take some supplements. </strong>Vitamin supplements, especially the supplements of vitamins C, E and D can do wonders to your skin’s elasticity.</li><li><strong>Massage the stretch mark-prone areas with lotions.</strong> They should contain vitamins K, C, E and A.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2401ff17ea00ff02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kasie Hunt's bio: Age, eye injury, parents, wedding, pregnancy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Studies have shown that being prone to developing stretch marks is hereditary. If your mother and her mother before that had stretch marks on their skin, especially while they were pregnant, chances are, you might develop them as well.</p><h2>Are stretch marks bad?</h2><p class=align-left>When it comes down to it, stretch marks are not bad. They do not cause any pain or harm. However, they might itch sometimes, if the skin is too dry. The only thing stretch marks can be bad for is the person’s self-esteem, as some people feel uncomfortable in their own skin because of the way it looks. The only way to deal with that is to embrace the stretch marks as something natural and move on.</p><h2>Do stretch marks cause itching?</h2><p class=align-left>Stretch marks might become itchy and even change in colour if the skin is too dry. Usually, it is nothing to worry about. A little bit of lotion should fix that right away. However, if the itch is persistent and does not go away, you should probably ask a doctor for advice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ea0a319b51414ad6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Business ideas in Nigeria: 50 workable opportunities in 2022</span></p></a><h2>Is stretch marks on breast a sign of pregnancy?</h2><p class=align-left>If you notice stretch marks appearing on your breasts, it might be because you are pregnant. However, as we have established before, pregnancy is not the only reason why you might be getting stretch marks. Therefore, you should look out for other symptoms of pregnancy before jumping to conclusions.</p><h2>Do stretch marks go away naturally?</h2><p class=align-left>Well, depending on what you mean by ‘go away’. Stretch marks never go away in the sense that the skin returns to the way it used to be. However, they usually become much lighter with time. Some people might notice them fade away very quickly and become barely noticeable, while others might not see any changes for a while (or ever). For the latter, we have outlined the ways they can make their stretch marks become lighter faster.</p><h2>Are stretch marks genetic?</h2><p class=align-left>Studies have shown that being prone to developing stretch marks is hereditary.
