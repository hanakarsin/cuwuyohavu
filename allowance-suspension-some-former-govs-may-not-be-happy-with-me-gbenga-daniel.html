But even before then, naturally, a human being should not be entitled to double remuneration.</p><p>“So, for me like I said earlier on, for about 12 years I was not in public service, now that I am back in public service let me just make sure that I tidy things up and somebody just pointed out to me and say why don’t I just remind the governor that I am not here and he should please stop the monthly pension that he was paying and hopefully when I am out of the Senate we check what the law says.”</p><p>He added that if after his stay at the Senate and it happens that Senators have emoluments, he may continue with that or revert to the one the Ogun State government was paying him as a former governor.</p><p>The former governor said the reactions to the development clearly indicate that things that appear to be normal are becoming unusual in the country.</p><p>Daniel also said that the reactions show that people are not happy with public figures any longer as they are sceptical that the officials will not do the right thing.</p><p>The Senator added that it is high time public officers started to lay good examples of a better society where the value system is the order of the day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BqZpqknKTEorrCnmSsraOlsq%2B%2FyKilZquforJuss6rpJ6qXZy8t7%2BMppiyZZ6kwW6uxGafmqigrnq4tdOhZKadXZyvprrGmmSdmZ6esq17</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./details-of-tinubus-meeting-with-ibb-in-minna-emerge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Details Of Tinubus Meeting With IBB In Minna Emerge">&larr;
